    "An important component of nerve fibers is that they are 3d objects.\n",
    "Therefore, they should not overlap each other.\n",
    "To achieve this, an [algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.10284) was developed based on collision checking of conical objects.\n",
    "A conical object is defined by two  neighboring points in the fiber array, i.e. fiber[i] and fiber[i+1].\n",
    "\n",
    "The class `solver` checks a given fiber model for collisions and resolves these collisions iteratively by small displacements.\n",
    "\n",
    "To account for the flexibility of fibers, they are continuously divided into segments. These segments are modeled geometrically as cones.\n",
    "\n",
    "A parallel implementation of an octree is used to run the collision detection algorithm between these cones."
